This page covers Fory configuration options and serialization modes.

## Serialization Modes

Apache Fory™ supports two serialization modes:

### Compatible Mode (xlang default)

Compatible mode is recommended for cross-language services because schemas can diverge more
easily across languages:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).compatible(true).build();
```

### SchemaConsistent Mode

Type declarations must match exactly between peers:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().xlang(true).compatible(false).build();
```

### Compatible Mode

For native Rust-only payloads, compatible mode is still explicit:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().compatible(true).build();
```

## Configuration

### Maximum Dynamic Object Nesting Depth

Apache Fory™ provides protection against stack overflow from deeply nested dynamic objects during deserialization. By default, the maximum nesting depth is set to 5 levels for trait objects and containers.

**Default configuration:**

```rust
let fory = Fory::default(); // max_dyn_depth = 5
```

**Custom depth limit:**

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder().max_dyn_depth(10).build(); // Allow up to 10 levels
```

**When to adjust:**

- **Increase**: For legitimate deeply nested data structures
- **Decrease**: For stricter security requirements or shallow data structures

**Protected types:**

- `Box<dyn Any>`, `Rc<dyn Any>`, `Arc<dyn Any>`
- `Box<dyn Trait>`, `Rc<dyn Trait>`, `Arc<dyn Trait>` (trait objects)
- `RcWeak<T>`, `ArcWeak<T>`
- Collection types (Vec, HashMap, HashSet)
- Nested struct types in Compatible mode

Note: Static data types (non-dynamic types) are secure by nature and not subject to depth limits, as their structure is known at compile time.

### Cross-Language Mode

Enable cross-language serialization:

```rust
let fory = Fory::builder()
    .compatible(true)
    .xlang(true).build();
```

## Builder Pattern

```rust
use fory::Fory;

// Default configuration
let fory = Fory::default();

// Compatible mode for schema evolution
let fory = Fory::builder().compatible(true).build();

// Cross-language mode
let fory = Fory::builder()
    .compatible(true)
    .xlang(true).build();

// Custom depth limit
let fory = Fory::builder().max_dyn_depth(10).build();

// Combined configuration
let fory = Fory::builder()
    .compatible(true)
    .xlang(true)
    .max_dyn_depth(10).build();
```

## Configuration Summary

| Option               | Description                             | Default |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `compatible(bool)`   | Enable schema evolution                 | `false` |
| `xlang(bool)`        | Enable cross-language mode              | `false` |
| `max_dyn_depth(u32)` | Maximum nesting depth for dynamic types | `5`     |
