This page explains the `Fory` constructor options.

## Creating a `Fory` Instance

Pass options directly to the constructor:

```dart
import 'package:fory/fory.dart';

// defaults — good for most single-service scenarios
final fory = Fory();

// cross-language service with schema evolution
final fory = Fory(
  compatible: true,
  maxDepth: 512,
);
```

Create one instance per application and reuse it; there is no benefit to creating a new `Fory` per request.

## Options

### `compatible`

Set to `true` when your service needs to handle payloads from code that may have a different version of the same model — for example, when you deploy services independently and cannot guarantee that both sides update at the same time.

```dart
final fory = Fory(compatible: true);
```

When `compatible: true`:

- Adding or removing fields on one side does not break the other.
- Peers must still use the same `namespace` + `typeName` (or numeric `id`) to identify types.

When `compatible: false`:

- Both sides must have exactly the same schema. This is slightly faster and is fine when schemas do not change or all services deploy schema changes at the same time.

### `checkStructVersion`

Relevant only when `compatible: false`. When `true`, Fory validates that the schema version in the payload matches the one the receiver knows about, catching accidental schema mismatches at runtime.

```dart
final fory = Fory(
  compatible: false,
  checkStructVersion: true, // default
);
```

This option has no effect when `compatible: true`.

### `maxDepth`

Limits how deeply nested an object graph can be. Increase this if you have legitimately deep trees; lower it to reject unexpectedly deep payloads fast.

```dart
final fory = Fory(maxDepth: 128);
```

### `maxCollectionSize`

Maximum number of elements accepted in any single list, set, or map field. Prevents runaway memory allocation from malformed messages.

```dart
final fory = Fory(maxCollectionSize: 100000);
```

### `maxBinarySize`

Maximum number of bytes accepted for any single binary blob field.

```dart
final fory = Fory(maxBinarySize: 8 * 1024 * 1024);
```

## Defaults

| Option               | Default   |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| `compatible`         | `false`   |
| `checkStructVersion` | `true`    |
| `maxDepth`           | 256       |
| `maxCollectionSize`  | 1 048 576 |
| `maxBinarySize`      | 64 MiB    |

## Cross-Language Notes

When Fory is used to communicate between services written in different languages:

- Set `compatible: true` on **all** sides if any side needs schema evolution.
- Use the same numeric IDs or `namespace + typeName` pairs on every side.
- Match the `compatible` setting on both the writing and reading side — mismatching modes will fail.
