This page covers `Config` and recommended Fory presets.

## Config

`Fory` is configured with:

```swift
public struct Config {
  public let trackRef: Bool
  public let compatible: Bool
  public let checkClassVersion: Bool
  public let maxCollectionSize: Int
  public let maxBinarySize: Int
  public let maxDepth: Int
}
```

Default configuration:

```swift
let fory = Fory() // ref=false, compatible=true
```

Swift supports the xlang wire format only, so there is no `xlang` option in
`Config` or the `Fory` initializer.

## Threading

`Fory` is single-threaded and optimized to reuse one read/write context pair on the calling thread.
Reuse one instance per thread and do not use the same instance concurrently.

## Options

### `trackRef`

Enables shared/circular reference tracking for reference-trackable types.

- `false`: No reference table (smaller/faster for acyclic or value-only graphs)
- `true`: Preserve object identity for class/reference graphs

```swift
let fory = Fory(ref: true)
```

### `compatible`

Enables compatible schema mode for evolution across versions.

- `false`: Faster serialization and smaller size
- `true`: Compatible mode (supports add/remove/reorder fields)

Use `compatible: false` only when every reader and writer always uses the same schema and you want faster serialization and smaller size. For cross-language payloads, set `compatible: false` only after verifying that every language uses the same schema, or when native types are generated from Fory schema IDL.

```swift
let fory = Fory(compatible: false)
```

### `checkClassVersion`

Controls class-version validation when compatible mode is disabled. When
omitted, it defaults to `true` when `compatible: false` and `false` when
`compatible: true`.

```swift
let fory = Fory(compatible: false, checkClassVersion: true)
```

### Size and Depth Limits

`maxCollectionSize`, `maxBinarySize`, and `maxDepth` bound decoded payload size
and nesting depth.

```swift
let fory = Fory(maxCollectionSize: 1_000_000, maxBinarySize: 64 * 1024 * 1024, maxDepth: 5)
```

## Recommended Presets

### Default service payloads

```swift
let fory = Fory()
```

### Graph/object identity workloads

```swift
let fory = Fory(ref: true)
```

### Same-schema optimization

Use this only when every reader and writer always uses the same schema.

```swift
let fory = Fory(compatible: false)
```

## Security

Security-related configuration:

- Register only the expected generated models before deserializing untrusted payloads.
- Use `checkClassVersion` with `compatible: false` for intentional same-schema payloads.
- Set `maxCollectionSize`, `maxBinarySize`, and `maxDepth` for the largest payload shape your
  service accepts.
