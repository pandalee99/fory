This page covers `ForyConfig` and recommended runtime presets.

## ForyConfig

`Fory` is configured with:

```swift
public struct ForyConfig {
    public var xlang: Bool
    public var trackRef: Bool
    public var compatible: Bool
}
```

Default configuration:

```swift
let fory = Fory() // xlang=true, ref=false, compatible=true
```

## Threading

`Fory` is single-threaded and optimized to reuse one read/write context pair on the calling thread.
Reuse one instance per thread and do not use the same instance concurrently.

## Options

### `xlang`

Controls cross-language protocol mode.

- `true`: Use xlang wire format (default)
- `false`: Use Swift-native mode

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: true, compatible: true)
```

### `trackRef`

Enables shared/circular reference tracking for reference-trackable types.

- `false`: No reference table (smaller/faster for acyclic or value-only graphs)
- `true`: Preserve object identity for class/reference graphs

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: true, ref: true, compatible: true)
```

### `compatible`

Enables compatible schema mode for evolution across versions.

- `false`: Schema-consistent mode (stricter, lower metadata overhead)
- `true`: Compatible mode (supports add/remove/reorder fields)

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: true, ref: false, compatible: true)
```

## Recommended Presets

### Local, strict schema

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: false, ref: false, compatible: false)
```

### Cross-language service payloads

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: true, ref: false, compatible: true)
```

### Graph/object identity workloads

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: true, ref: true, compatible: true)
```
