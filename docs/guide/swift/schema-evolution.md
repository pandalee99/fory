Fory supports schema evolution through compatible mode.

## Enable Compatible Mode

```swift
let fory = Fory(xlang: true, ref: false, compatible: true)
```

## Example: Evolving a Struct

```swift
import Fory

@ForyStruct
struct PersonV1 {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int32 = 0
    var address: String = ""
}

@ForyStruct
struct PersonV2 {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int32 = 0
    var phone: String? = nil // added field
}

let writer = Fory(xlang: true, compatible: true)
writer.register(PersonV1.self, id: 1)

let reader = Fory(xlang: true, compatible: true)
reader.register(PersonV2.self, id: 1)

let v1 = PersonV1(name: "alice", age: 30, address: "main st")
let bytes = try writer.serialize(v1)
let v2: PersonV2 = try reader.deserialize(bytes)

assert(v2.name == "alice")
assert(v2.age == 30)
assert(v2.phone == nil)
```

## What Is Safe in Compatible Mode

- Add new fields
- Remove old fields
- Reorder fields

## What Is Not Safe

- Arbitrary type changes for an existing field (for example `Int32` to `String`)
- Inconsistent registration mapping across peers

## Schema-consistent Mode Behavior

With `compatible=false`, Fory validates schema hash and fails fast on mismatch.
