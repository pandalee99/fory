This page covers common C# runtime issues and fixes.

## `TypeNotRegisteredException`

**Symptom**: `Type not registered: ...`

**Cause**: A user type was serialized/deserialized without registration.

**Fix**:

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder().Build();
fory.Register<MyType>(100);
```

Ensure the same type-ID/name mapping exists on both write and read sides.

## `InvalidDataException: xlang bitmap mismatch`

**Cause**: The payload is not an xlang Fory frame, or it came from a peer/runtime mode that does
not emit the xlang header C# requires.

**Fix**: Ensure the payload was produced by an xlang-compatible peer runtime. C# always expects the
xlang header and does not expose a mode switch, so configure the writer instead:

```java
Fory fory = Fory.builder()
    .withXlang(true)
    .build();
```

```python
fory = pyfory.Fory(xlang=True)
```

## Schema Version Mismatch in Strict Mode

**Symptom**: `InvalidDataException` while deserializing generated struct types.

**Cause**: `Compatible(false)` with `CheckStructVersion(true)` enforces exact schema hashes.

**Fix options**:

- Enable `Compatible(true)` for schema evolution.
- Keep writer/reader model definitions in sync.

## Circular Reference Failures

**Symptom**: Stack overflow-like recursion or graph reconstruction issues.

**Cause**: Cyclic graphs with `TrackRef(false)`.

**Fix**:

```csharp
Fory fory = Fory.Builder().TrackRef(true).Build();
```

## Concurrency Issues

**Cause**: Sharing a single `Fory` instance across threads.

**Fix**: Use `BuildThreadSafe()`.

## Validation Commands

Run C# tests from repo root:

```bash
cd csharp
dotnet test Fory.sln -c Release
```
