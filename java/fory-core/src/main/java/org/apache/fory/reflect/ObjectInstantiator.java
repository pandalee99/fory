 * Abstract base class for instantiating instances of a given type.

 * strategies such as constructor invocation, unsafe allocation, and record creation.
 * Implementations handle various scenarios including no-arg constructors, parameterized
 * constructors for records, and platform-specific optimizations.
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> All implementations of ObjectInstantiator are thread-safe and
 * can be safely used across multiple threads concurrently. The underlying instantiation mechanisms
 * (MethodHandle, Constructor, and supported constructor-bypassing allocation) are all thread-safe.
