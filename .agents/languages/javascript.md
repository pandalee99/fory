# JavaScript And TypeScript

Load this file when changing `javascript/`.

## Rules

- Run JavaScript and TypeScript commands from within `javascript/`.
- This implementation uses npm or yarn for package management.
- IDL Jest tests should stay local to generated-code construction and local `Fory` serialize/deserialize assertions. Java-driven peer orchestration belongs in the existing integration harness.
- Language peer entrypoints under `integration_tests/idl_tests` should mirror existing peers and validate semantic equality, not just deserialize and reserialize bytes.
- Preserve generated serializer hot paths that bind writer, reader, ref, resolver, and metadata locals in outer closures; do not replace them with per-call context lookups without a measured reason.
- Runtime value carriers such as decimal or reduced-precision numeric types belong under the core `types/` ownership boundary, with imports, exports, and codegen externals updated together.
- Keep `TypeInfo` as schema metadata. Compatibility-sensitive decisions belong on `TypeResolver` or explicit operations, not as retained resolver state on metadata objects.
- Normalize optional boolean config values at config construction; do not carry `null` through runtime paths when it means `false`.
- Regenerated compatible read serializers are remote-schema-specific. After classification marks a field as direct, compatible scalar, or skip, generated JavaScript should emit straight-line remote-field-order code. Do not add an outer matched-id switch unless the current regenerated shape cannot preserve those semantics.
- Compatible scalar codegen must decide the exact remote/local scalar pair before emitting source. Generate the concrete `reader.readXxx()` call plus inline trivial conversions such as boolean-to-string or numeric widening, and keep helpers only for semantic validation such as range checks, exactness checks, decimal parsing/formatting, and string-to-bool. Do not call a generic hot-path converter that redispatches on `remoteTypeId`, `localTypeId`, field descriptors, or field names.
- Compatible scalar conversion is immediate-field-only. Recursive schema comparison for collection elements, array elements, map keys, and map values must reject scalar mismatches instead of applying the top-level scalar conversion matrix.
