## Agent Operating Rules

- Preserve architecture. Do not introduce new layers, parallel flows, or public APIs unless explicitly requested; prefer local repair in the existing owner over shared-infra expansion, and stop if a fix conflicts with an ADR, spec, or invariant.
- Respect ownership. Keep logic, state, and helpers in their natural owner, and do not move serializer-local, context-local, runtime-type-local, or protocol-local problems into global utilities.
- Check the spec before implementation. For wire behavior and xlang mapping, use the specs as the source of truth and never copy one runtime's bug into another runtime just to make tests pass.
- Reject semantic hacks. Do not bypass broken semantics by deleting cases, simplifying callers, adding coercion hooks, or using workaround fallbacks; fix the underlying bug and prove it with focused tests.
- Protect hot paths. Avoid per-call allocations, callback objects, result tuples or records, unnecessary runtime branches, and wrapper-class substitutions in hot codec/runtime paths; prefer conditional imports and allocation-free concrete implementations where they fit the language.
- Keep public APIs minimal. Public APIs must match user ownership and mental model, not internal implementation details; generated flows stay type-owned, while manual serializer registration stays explicit.
- Use semantic naming only. Name things after protocol or domain concepts, not history, runtime origin, or workaround style; avoid vague names such as `Internal`, `java_style_*`, `Runtime`, `Session`, `Plan`, or `Binding` when they do not name the real concept.
- Keep one implementation path. Do not keep parallel helpers, serializers, harnesses, wrappers, or registration flows for the same concept; extend the existing owner path instead of inventing another one.
- Follow current scope exactly. The latest explicit user instruction overrides earlier plans, and when scope narrows, remove leaked out-of-scope edits immediately.
- Verification is required. Match validation to the real ownership path: compile, tests, xlang, native-image, non-VM compile, benchmarks, and remote CI as applicable; reasoning alone is never enough.
- Finish the whole surface. A feature or behavior change is incomplete until code, tests, docs, exports, examples, and build wiring agree, unless the user explicitly defers part of that surface.
- Keep task boundaries strict. Review tasks do not edit code, analysis-only tasks do not silently turn into implementation, and active-branch fixes must land in the active branch/workspace.
- For non-trivial multi-step tasks, write the plan and progress into the canonical durable task file (use a matched skill/workflow file if it provides one, otherwise use a file under `tasks/`) and read that file after compaction before continuing.

## Repo-Wide Hard Rules

- Do not preserve legacy, dead, or useless code, tests, or docs unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Ignore internal API compatibility unless the user explicitly requests it. Do not keep shims, wrappers, or transitional paths only to preserve internal call sites.
- Performance is the top priority. Do not introduce regressions without explicit justification.
- "Refactor" means changing structure, ownership, naming, or API shape without changing behavior, wire format, or implementation strategy unless the user explicitly asks for those changes.
- Do not make design tradeoffs the user did not request. If a refactor appears to require a behavior, logic, protocol, or performance tradeoff, stop and ask.
- Treat existing low-level or optimized code as deliberate by default. During a refactor, preserve the current implementation strategy unless the user explicitly asks to redesign or optimize it.
- Do not replace existing C, C++, Cython, unsafe, or other low-level optimized paths with simpler high-level implementations just to make a refactor easier.
- If a refactor accidentally changes logic or implementation strategy, revert that part and re-implement the refactor around the existing logic.
- Use English only in code, comments, and documentation.
- After editing any Markdown file, run `prettier --write <file>` on each changed Markdown file before finishing.
- Add comments only when behavior is hard to understand or an algorithm is non-obvious.
- Do not remove existing code comments unless they are stale, misleading, redundant, or no longer necessary after the change.
- Only add tests that verify internal behaviors or fix specific bugs; do not create unnecessary tests unless requested.
- Do not add cleanup-sentinel tests that only pin deleted APIs or removed fields.
- Tests must exercise the actual code you wrote or changed. Do not write tests that pass by exercising a pre-existing code path that produces similar-looking results. Before writing a test, identify the exact new code path (annotation, codegen output, new API) and verify the test would fail if that code path were removed. When the change involves codegen or annotations, the test must use those annotations on real structs, run through the codegen pipeline, and verify the generated output drives the expected runtime behavior.
- When reading code, skip files not tracked by git by default unless you generated them yourself or the task explicitly requires them.
- Maintain cross-language consistency while respecting language-specific idioms.
- Keep one active ownership path per concept. Do not leave duplicate serializers, resolvers, helpers, or registration paths for the same type family unless the split is deliberate and documented.
- Name new or touched APIs, helpers, and tests after protocol concepts, data-model semantics, or user-visible behavior; avoid names based on runtime origin, bug history, storage details, or temporary workarounds.
- For public cross-runtime or protocol features, update runtime support, compiler/codegen wiring, public exports, docs, specs/type mappings, integration fixtures, and tests together unless the user explicitly defers part of that scope.
- Do not introduce checked exceptions in new code or new APIs.
- Do not use `ThreadLocal` or other ambient runtime-context patterns in Java runtime code. `WriteContext`, `ReadContext`, and `CopyContext` state must stay explicit, generated serializers must not retain context fields, and `Fory` must stay a root-operation facade rather than accumulating serializer/runtime convenience state.
- When a serializer class and constructor shape are known at the call site, prefer direct constructor lambdas or direct instantiation over reflective `Serializers.newSerializer(...)`. Keep reflection for dynamic or general construction paths only.
- For GraalVM, use `fory codegen` to generate serializers when building native images. Do not use GraalVM reflection configuration except for JDK `proxy`.
- In Java native mode (`xlang=false`), only `Types.BOOL` through `Types.STRING` share type IDs with xlang mode (`xlang=true`). Other native-mode type IDs differ.
- Keep class registration enabled unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Prefer schema-consistent mode unless compatibility work requires something else.
- When debugging test errors, always set `ENABLE_FORY_DEBUG_OUTPUT=1` to see debug output.
- Never work around failures. Find and fix the root cause. Do not hack, weaken, or bypass tests to make them pass.

## Source of Truth

- Primary references: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, and language guides under `docs/guide/`.
- Protocol changes require reading and updating the relevant specs in `docs/specification/**` and aligning the relevant cross-language tests.
- If instructions conflict, follow the most specific module docs and call out the conflict.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` plus updates under `docs/guide/` and `docs/benchmarks/` are synced to `apache/fory-site`; other website content belongs there.
- When benchmark logic, scripts, configuration, or compared serializers change, rerun the relevant benchmarks and refresh the artifacts under `docs/benchmarks/**`.

## Shared Engineering Expectations

- Favor zero-copy techniques, JIT or codegen opportunities, and cache-friendly memory access patterns in performance-critical paths.
- Keep hot paths allocation-minimal. Avoid per-call or per-element object allocation, boxing, wrapper round-trips, callbacks, iterator carriers, or holder objects unless there is a measured reason and no lower-allocation design preserves the same behavior.
- Keep hot-path control flow direct and predictable. Hoist repeated buffer/cache/state lookups into locals for multi-step operations, keep cold rebuild or restoration logic on slow branches, and avoid tiny forwarding helpers that only obscure the owner.
- In unified native/xlang hot paths, branch only where the wire format or protocol behavior actually differs. Do not add mode booleans or mode-specific helper parameters for equivalent behavior.
- Public APIs must be well-documented and easy to understand. When adding a public API, write source-level API documentation in the owning code.
- Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages.
- Use strong typing and generics appropriately.
- Handle null values appropriately for each language.
- Preserve protocol compatibility across languages.
- Read and respect `docs/specification/xlang_type_mapping.md` when changing cross-language type behavior.
- Handle byte order correctly for cross-platform compatibility.
- If the reference implementation is not right, do not tweak another language's correct implementation to align with a wrong reference implementation just to make tests pass; fix the runtime that diverged from the spec.

## Git And Review Rules

- Use `git@github.com:apache/fory.git` as the remote repository. Do not use other remotes when you want to check code under `main`; `apache/main` is the only target main branch instead of `origin/main`.
- Treat `apache/main` as the only mainline baseline, not `origin/main`.
- Before any diff, review, or compare work against `apache/main`, run `git fetch apache main` so comparisons use the latest remote main.
- When reviewing a GitHub pull request, always do the review in a new local git worktree. Do not switch the current branch or reuse the current worktree for that review unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Contributors should fork `git@github.com:apache/fory.git`, push code changes to the fork, and open pull requests from that fork into `apache/fory`.

## Shared Validation Expectations

- Run the relevant tests for every touched language or subsystem before finishing.
- When multiple independent language test suites are required, run them concurrently when the environment has enough resources instead of running them one by one; keep each language's logs and results separate, and rerun any failed suite with focused diagnostics.
- Run applicable test commands in a subagent with a thinking budget one level lower than the main task budget, using medium when the current budget is unclear, unless the change is docs-only or the user explicitly asks to run them locally.
- Reuse the same test subagent for repeated runs within one task and subsystem so it keeps failure context; create a fresh subagent when switching unrelated subsystems or when prior context may be stale or misleading.
- Use `integration_tests/` for cross-language compatibility validation when behavior crosses runtimes.
- If xlang behavior or type mapping changes, run `org.apache.fory.xlang.CPPXlangTest`, `org.apache.fory.xlang.CSharpXlangTest`, `org.apache.fory.xlang.RustXlangTest`, `org.apache.fory.xlang.GoXlangTest`, and `org.apache.fory.xlang.PythonXlangTest`.
- If Swift xlang behavior changes, run `org.apache.fory.xlang.SwiftXlangTest` too.
- For performance regressions or optimizations, profile or otherwise measure the current branch and a fresh `apache/main` baseline before changing code; optimize the measured hotspot, not guessed code.
- Do not change protocol behavior, benchmark payloads, or public APIs solely to manufacture performance wins.
- For performance work, run the relevant benchmark immediately after each change and report the command plus before/after numbers.
- For performance-optimization rounds, append the hypothesis, change, benchmark command, before/after numbers, and keep/revert decision to `tasks/perf_optimization_rounds.md`.
- For refactors on performance-sensitive code, validate not only tests but also that no implementation-strategy drift was introduced relative to `apache/main` unless the user explicitly asked for that change.

## Working Process

1. Read the relevant specs, guides, and focused `.agents/*.md` files before editing.
2. Understand the affected architecture, subsystem boundaries, and existing tests before changing behavior.
3. Review related issues for context when the change is tied to a known bug, regression, or feature request.
4. Follow the language-specific rules in `.agents/languages/*.md` for the touched runtimes.
5. Update docs, examples, and specs when public behavior, protocol behavior, or workflows change.
6. Format and verify the changed areas before concluding.
7. For refactors, identify the invariants that must not change before editing: behavior, protocol or wire format, implementation strategy, and performance-sensitive data structures.
8. If code is already optimized, refactor around it instead of simplifying it.
9. When in doubt during a refactor, prefer preserving the existing implementation over cleaning it up.
