# Apache Fory™ Go

Fory is a blazingly fast multi-language serialization framework powered by just-in-time compilation and zero-copy.

Currently, Fory Go is implemented using reflection. We have also implemented a static code generator to generate serializer code ahead of time to speed up serialization.

## Fory Go Codegen (optional)

This repository includes an optional ahead-of-time (AOT) code generator for Fory. The runtime reflection-based path continues to work; codegen exists to provide additional performance, type safety and zero-reflection overhead for hot paths. You can adopt it incrementally, per package or per file.

### Why codegen (rationale)

- Faster (no reflection on the hot path)
- Type-safe serialization/deserialization with predictable layouts
- Smaller GC pressure and fewer allocations
- Compile-time guards to detect stale generated code when struct definitions change

Note: Code generation is not mandatory. If you prefer simple workflows, you can keep using the reflection-based API.

### Install the generator

The generator binary is `fory`.

- Go 1.16+ (recommended):

```bash
go install github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/cmd/fory@latest
```

- Go 1.13+

```bash
# Inside a module-enabled environment
GO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/apache/fory/go/fory/cmd/fory

# Or clone the repo and install from source
git clone https://github.com/apache/fory.git
cd fory/go/fory
go install ./cmd/fory
```

Ensure $GOBIN or $GOPATH/bin is on your PATH so that `fory` is discoverable by `go generate`.

### Usage: annotate and generate

1. Mark structs for generation with `//fory:gen`, and add a `go:generate` directive. File-based generation is recommended.

```go
package yourpkg

//fory:gen
type User struct {
    ID   int64  `json:"id"`
    Name string `json:"name"`
}

//go:generate fory -file structs.go
```

Then run:

```bash
go generate
```

The generator will create `structs_fory_gen.go` next to your source file and register serializers in init().

2. Explicit types (legacy mode) are also supported:

```bash
fory -pkg ./models -type "User,Order"
```

### When to re-run `go generate`

Re-run generation whenever any of the following change for generated structs:

- Field additions/removals/renames
- Field type changes or tag changes
- New structs annotated with `//fory:gen`

Fory adds a compile-time guard in generated files to detect stale code. If you forget to re-generate, your build will fail with a clear message. The generator also includes a smart auto-retry: when invoked via `go generate`, it detects this situation, removes the stale generated file, and retries automatically. You can force this behavior manually with:

```bash
fory --force -file structs.go
```

### What gets generated (simplified example)

Below is a minimal illustration. Actual output includes strongly-typed serializers, interface-compatible methods, registration, and a compile-time snapshot of your struct.

```go
// Code generated by fory. DO NOT EDIT.
package yourpkg

// Snapshot of User's underlying type at generation time.
type _User_expected struct {
    ID   int64
    Name string
}

// Compile-time check: fails if User no longer matches the snapshot.
// If this fails, run: go generate
var _ = func(x User) { _ = _User_expected(x) }

type User_ForyGenSerializer struct{}

func (User_ForyGenSerializer) WriteTyped(f *fory.Fory, buf *fory.ByteBuffer, v *User) error {
    // write fields in a stable order
    buf.WriteInt64(v.ID)
    fory.WriteString(buf, v.Name)
    return nil
}

func (User_ForyGenSerializer) ReadTyped(f *fory.Fory, buf *fory.ByteBuffer, v *User) error {
    v.ID = buf.ReadInt64()
    v.Name = fory.ReadString(buf)
    return nil
}
```

### CI and version control (should I check in generated code?)

Both models are supported; choose based on your workflow:

- Check in generated code (recommended for libraries)
  - Pros: Consumers can build without the generator; reproducible builds
  - Cons: Larger diffs; must remember to re-generate before commit

- Do not check in; generate in CI/release pipeline (recommended for apps)
  - Add a step to your pipeline, e.g.:
    - `go generate ./...`
    - Optionally `fory --force -file <file.go>` for targeted regeneration

Regardless of your choice, the compile-time guard ensures that stale code is noticed early. If a build fails due to the guard in a local environment, run:

```bash
go generate
# If needed
fory --force -file <your file>
```

### FAQ

- Is codegen required? No. Fory works without it via reflection.
- Does generated code work across Go versions? Yes, it’s plain Go code; keep your toolchain consistent in CI.
- Can I mix generated and non-generated structs? Yes, adoption is incremental and per file.

## How to test

```bash
cd go/fory
go test -v
go test -v fory_xlang_test.go
```

## Code Style

```bash
cd go/fory
gofmt -s -w .
```

When using Go's gofmt -s -w . command on Windows, ensure your source files use Unix-style line endings (LF) instead of Windows-style (CRLF). Go tools expect LF by default, and mismatched line endings may cause unexpected behavior or unnecessary changes in version control.

Before committing, you can use `git config core.autocrlf input` to take effect on future commits.
